# B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire clustering
*Method to cluster some-what biologically similar B-cell receptors by Hamming distance.*
## *Introduction*
The vast B-cell repertoire data retrieved from RNA-seq would seem extremely diverse. It is convenient when biologically similar BCR can be classified and grouped as single entities to facilitate downsteam analysis. Hereby we proposed a method to cluster BCR with some-what similar CDR H3 amino acid sequences based on Hamming distance.
